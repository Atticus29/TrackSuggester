An interactive website that allows a user to fill out a survey with several questions. Based on the user's answers to those questions, the site will make a recommendation for a certain track to which the user might like to apply at Epicodus. The site contains one page, the content of which is dynamically adjusted upon submission of certain buttons on the page.

## Setup/Installation

* This repository is meant to be viewed. It can be viewed [here](https://Atticus29.github.io/TrackSuggester).

### Or if you're feeling bold, you can clone OR download a local instance of the site:

* Clone
  * Open your terminal program
    * On a Mac, this would be in the Applications/Utilities directory, and is called, "Terminal"
    * Windows uses a Terminal program as well, but a Terminal with all the capabilities we'll require is not installed by default. Thankfully, we can easily download and install a Terminal program that does fit our needs.
There are many options available, but we recommend using a terminal program called git bash. You can download this free program at [msysgit.github.io](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
